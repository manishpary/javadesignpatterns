/*
Advantages of encapsulation in Java
        We can make a class read-only or write-only: for a read-only class, we should provide only a getter method. For a write-only class, we should provide only a setter method.
        Control over the data: we can control the data by providing logic to setter methods, just like we restricted the stock keeper from assigning negative values in the above example.
        Data hiding: other classes canâ€™t access private members of a class directly.
